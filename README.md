## Bird Scouts

Bird Scouts is a web application created using streamlit to help nature enthusiasts and researchers identify bird species through image or audio inputs.
It also includes a tree species identification feature and a collaborative community map for bird sightings, creating an engaging way to explore and contribute to biodiversity knowledge.

 
This project is part of *UMC 301 - Applied Data Science and Artificial Intelligence* course at IISc. **[Presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AmpiQddBaHowNwmOWfrJYQHjGgEAjgNN2WpIVIsTEwI/edit#slide=id.g3176ed11d7c_1_21)**
